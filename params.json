  "body": "##### Made by [Gawain](https://github.com/agtcap1), [John](https://github.com/jpcolfer), and [KC](https://github.com/hornedCapybara). \r\nThis is a recreation of the board game [*Pandemic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_(board_game)) in [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/) and [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/). The cards are simulated using Python 3.5 & [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter), and the board and pieces are in Unity 3D.  Some might say we could have created everything in Unity, but to that I say no, that's stupid.  \r\n  \r\nWe started making the decks in Python, then worked it into a GUI with Tkinter. Then we decided to make it out final project for our class, and made a board and pieces in Unity. The .py files where compiled into .exe files with [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/). \r\n  \r\n[Wiki](https://github.com/hornedCapybara/Pandemic-in-Python/wiki)\r\n",
