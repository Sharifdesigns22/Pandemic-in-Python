# Pandemic in Python
##### Made by Gawain Taylor, John Colfer, and KC Jones. 
This is a recreation of the board game *Pandemic* in Python 3.5 and Unity 3D. The cards are simulated using Python 3.5 & Tkinter, and the board and pieces are in Unity 3D. Obviously we could have created everything in Unity, but to that I would say no, that's stupid.  
  
We started making the decks in Python, then worked it into a GUI with Tkinter. Then we decided to make it out final project for our class, and made a board and pieces in Unity. The .py files where compiled into .exe files with [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/).
